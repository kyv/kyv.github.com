  <h2>Iliad and Odyssey</h2>

<pre><code>I have always made war
lifting pen against the state of the word
fist against the terms of the state
is it that the horizon which the warrior watches
is the intersection of war and love?
after stirring up the termos,
return to live them in their given state
i wonder if its true that after the war
one can go back home
</code></pre>

<h2>big creek</h2>

<pre><code>men don´t exist
    they drowned in a dead dream
    a few of their memories swim eternally
    since life is easier to abandon than a dream
    the rest sunk forever into the garbage at the bottom

no one knows about the women
    they roll the dough instead of hours
    util hope persists
    as that which is and that which is not
    soletude and waiting
    maybe the current will free a captive dream
    and what no one knows will once again embrace nothing

men are not
    they died with their gods
    like serpents, leaving only a change of skin
    which empty as a bubble rises to the light
    or sinks for its wieght
</code></pre>

<h2>soul</h2>

<pre><code>reader beware, when reading by candlelight
you fish at night, and material things convert to shadows very sudenly

now in open sea:
from the letter, itself a kind of shadow, 
arises another sign different from what is written
</code></pre>

<h2>parking lot</h2>

<pre><code>if it was a buble, like they say, with only the point of a pin it would bust

or maybe it is another kind of bubble, of some other liguid, like mercury for example
and thats why it goes up and down with the weather
just as the earch is a bubble in the void
and carbon monoxide y moffles
    anihilate sound and air

its like feeling alone, lost in an enourmous parking lot:

the bubble rises from the void, and the void from the bubble
</code></pre>

<h2>Smoke</h2>

<pre><code>body is a rite,  without reference to bibles

the moon incends
the very leters of your pronounciation
i´ll smoke the rest with a pipe
    that someone else must have forgotton
        in another moment, the same as this one
            after the fire
                without tabaco
</code></pre>

<h2>A Metaphore</h2>

<pre><code>it occurs to me that i dicided
but only after diciding
    in fact now very deep in an alleyway, for example, or a cave

¿it was where it took a right?
¿i should have taken a left?

the wall close in
but when the roof collapses
i jump up, or dive into the sea below
or i just plain die, but even so

anyway its just a metaphor
</code></pre>

<h2>A Book Just Like This One</h2>

<pre><code>this book written by some Mephistofoles,
or some cursed mage, or heretic
could it be that she is a monster for loving a book like this one
or simply that she is capable of loving a monstor
and what does it mean for that book of heresy, of vanity and anger
    that some one like her loves it
</code></pre>

<h2>Bird With Pencil</h2>

<pre><code>a bird! - she said, and i saw it too when it descended from a branch and advanced toward
the road. it was the same color of the pines and must have encounted a discarded pencil
nearby, which t now carried in its beak. it made as if it would write, or wrote, because 
when it flew away toward the tempest in the west, we approached where now there was left 
only a paper with a mark more or less in the form of a heart. 

do birds write? - she asked. 
or the harpie of the tempest bewitched the bird?
or it is us who are bewitched?
</code></pre>

<h2>Diagnosis Zombie</h2>

<pre><code>we are afraid, we alienate

its that there was a sickness
that infected many people
and in order to garantee the living their lives
they had to evoke the most intoxicating of shadows
    death in its living image

and to evoke it in the name of paranoia
they made of the world a jail
and thats why if you kill even the last of them
they always come back in the sequel

and its not a metafore of love
nor of war
but what i saw, or halucinated
when one of them bit me on my rear
</code></pre>

<h2>Archeology</h2>

<pre><code>who would sew their gown
of the yarn of so many spiders?

was it because they waited long?
or because they hurried?
    to wait for the arrival of one who was lost far away?
    or hida away from who was nearest?

i read a myth
    in some book
        that time passes
            and tomorrow is always to come
            until everythings over and at last
            we get out the fireworks and champaign and
                we eat fine meats and even the 
                universe is extinguished
            as if the stars were only
                flags that fell upon the ending of the empire of the night

            but you continue
            after so many revolutions
            just like any other continent
</code></pre>

<h2>Dobles</h2>

<pre><code>how do you know?

because if there were another
the same as me
alive in the world
he or i, one of us
    would have killed the other a long time ago
</code></pre>

<h2>Heaven is Work</h2>

<pre><code>god, 

it is of little importance if there is a vacancy in heaven,
anyway i´ve no idea of what to put in my resume.
</code></pre>

<h2>Song of Self-Enchantment</h2>

<pre><code>tongue, cord
pull me forward
now that i´ve grown tired of pushing

pull me tongue, i don´t even want to think about it
    tongue, bed, a good nights rest
    tongue, voice, pronounce

say, sound, i don´t know a single leter
or where else to take cover from the rains of flavors?
</code></pre>

<h2>Marcelas Tomb</h2>

<pre><code>i descended to the tomb of marcela
the following evening
to find a solitary bottle cap
without a trace of a bottle
that survived the party

sister, its your fault
that a grey and portensious cloud
has descended over the hillside donde gentlemen pray

it has not yet rained, and we have attempted
collect those ashes that remain within reach
and mix them in a wax
in order to make and infinity of candels
so that if one goes out, its a question of lighting another
</code></pre>

<h2>we only reconize each other in death</h2>

<pre><code>we only reconize each other in death
as when dia no stars appear
thats why we wait in the crossroads
looking in all directions
</code></pre>

<h2>Extract from a Story</h2>

<pre><code>a rope that goes looping
around and around
inside until finally exposing who tells the tale
    not its author but who is the singer
</code></pre>

<h2>Wasps</h2>

<pre><code>the wasps are from
the pours of time

sew, with their needles,
memory and pain
in the skin of the children
who would trap them in their nets
atracted by their sound

wasps sound like something from cartoons
and their drawings are not tatoos, because the tatoo is something from the future
with the wasps its just the moment that hurts
</code></pre>

<h2>Bells</h2>

<pre><code>for the river
or rather for the fall of the water over the rock
    sounds like the bell

of the plaza, and i even heard a familiar voice
just before they opened the door and we all
went on to the ceremony

    that still resonates

from the times when a prayer arose by way of a howl
